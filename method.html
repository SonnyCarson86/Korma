  <h1>Create the Sauce</h1>
  First, we must gather and prepare the ingrededients. We can make a curry paste by rough chopping the garlic, ginger and shallots. <br>
  Add them into a blender or food processor and create a coarse paste. Remove from blender and set aside.<br>
  Add the Canned Tomato to the blender or food processor and create a coarse paste. Remove from blender and strain. Retain liquid.<br>
  Heat a pan and melt the clarified butter. Brown the meat in clarified butter.<br>
  Remove the meat from the pan and retain any rendered fat. Set aside meat and begin creating the sauce. <br>
  Add Whole Cinnamon, Clove, Black Cardamom, Coriander, Mustard Seed and Bay Leaf to ghee. Heat spices in oil until the mustard seed begins to sizzle.<br>
  Add curry paste to oil and fry under low heat until ingrededients begin to caramelize. <br>
  Add Chopped tomato and fry under low heat until tomatoes begin to dry. <br>
  Add Add Cashews, Cumin Powder, Turmeric Powder, Chilli Powder and fry until fragrant. <br>
  Add Tomato Juice and simmer until juice no longer tastes raw. <br>
  Remove ingredients from pan and carefully place inside blender. Blend until smooth, thinning the paste with coconut milk. <br>
  Strain through sieve and discard the grit. <br>
  Add salt and sugar to taste. <br>
