  <h3>What is Korma?</h3>
  <p>
    In the early 21st century, chicken korma surpassed chicken tikka masala as the most posular curry in the UK. <br>
    Korma is an anglicization of <em>qormeh</em> the Urdu word for braise. <br>
    This word, in turn, has its origins in the Turkic word <em>qawirma</em>, which means "something fried". <br>
    Korma is the perfect example of how words and ideas can cross cultures and evolve through food. <br>
    A quintisential Mughal Dish, modern day Korma has its roots in the royal courts of Medieval India.<br>
    A Korma typical contains braised meat in a sauce thickened with ground nuts, coconut milk and cream or yogurt. <br>
    Regional variations and ingredients provide endless opportunities to create new dishes with the <em>korma</em> style of cooking. <br>
    In this recipe, we will be preparing a standalone Korma Sauce made with Curry Paste, Tomato, Cashew and Coconut, and Spices, typical of the style found in Indian restaurants across the US.<br>
