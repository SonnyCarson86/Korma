  <h3>What is Korma?</h3>
  <p>
    In the early 21st century, Chicken Korma surpassed Chicken Tikka Masala as the most posular curry in the UK. <br>
    <strong>Korma</strong> is an anglicization of <em>qormeh</em> the Urdu word for braise. <br>
    This word, in turn, has its origins in the Turkic word <em>qawirma</em>, which means "something fried". <br>
    To make a Korma, meat is typically fried in curry paste and braised in liquid such as yogurt, cream or coconut milk. <br>
    Korma is the perfect example of how words and ideas can cross cultures and evolve through food. <br>
    A quintisential Mughal Dish, modern day Korma has its roots in the royal Moghlai courts of Medieval India.<br>
